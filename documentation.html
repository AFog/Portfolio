    <h1>Inroduction</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>This webpage was built from scratch and no template was used. I added all features by using examples and tutorials from www.w3schools.com, getbootstrap.com, youtube.com and several other websites. </li>
        <li>To begin I looked for a CV webpages that I liked and wrote down the feature they used that I would like to incorporate into my page</li>
        <li>The project is hosted on <a href="http://www.aaronfogarty.com/" target="_blank">aaronfogarty.com</a></li>
        <li>The project is available at <a href="https://github.com/AFog/Portfolio" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
    </ul>

<div id="DynamicContent" class="container-fluid">
<h1>Dynamic Content</h1>
    <ul><li>I used AngularJS  to create some dynamic content</li>
    <li> I dynamically added my exam results from a file rather than having to manually input the values. This can be seen in the Results JQuery Accordion</li>
    <li>I also dynamically added the current date and time. Thuis can be seen in the footer of the page.</li>
    <li>Enabling multiple angular components requires manually bootstrapping each of them 
        using the angular.bootstrap command</li>
        
    <br>
    <li>I used googe maps api to show my home adress in the contact section of the page. This required creating a google project enabling Maps JavaScript access and getting an API key to connect</li>    
    </ul>

<div class="container-fluid" id="InteractiveElement">
<h2>Interactive Elements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I found many elements to use at W3schools and getbootstrap</li>
        <li>I used a parallax to create the page heading that has my name, this is a nice feature and can be seen on a lot of the nicest web CVs.I aslo use a BS jumbotron in the header to show my photo and title</li>
        <li>The image in the jumbotron is a Modal and enlarges the image for closer view</li>
        <li>I aso used a Modal for one of my contact forms. This can be seen in the about section beside the social media images. This is a functional form, any messages submitted are sent to my email address. This feature was possible using 'JotForm' </li>
        <li>For the whole about section I used a carousel to display differnet sections of my CV. I seen this feature and like it and built my own version into the page</li>
        <li>I also used carousels in the Projects section to display project images</li>
        <li>The CV is built for multiple devices and works on mobile, I used a Grid system to enable this</li>
        <li>The Navnbar menu changes to a dropdown menu in mobile devices</li>
       
        <li>Navbar Toggle was used to replace the navbar with a button with arrows, on smaller screens</li>
